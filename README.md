# FPL stat attack!

The Fantasy Premier League is a free online competition run by the Barclays Premier League, with over 6 million entries. The game involves selecting players within the Barclay Premier League subject to positional and value-caps. For more information please review <a href="http://fantasy.premierleague.com/">the fantasy premier league website.</a>

Data is an important part of selecting a team, however the website only offers a limited amount of information for each player. The purpose of this Shiny application is to allow for users to gain greater access to some of the data behind the FPL website.
Currently this Shiny application has two components;
A "player analysis" tab, which allows for filtering of players based on recent performance across a range of metrics.
A "team analysis" tab, that looks at the relative difficulty of teams fixtures.

Data is pulled from the fantasy.premierleague.com wbesite on a regular basis.

This repository consists of the Shiny R , and some CSV files output during the process.

To come; a process of determining the "best" players based on recent performance, and predictions of future game results.
